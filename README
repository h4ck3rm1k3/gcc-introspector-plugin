some ideas  :

1. we will want to control the compiler via the gui.
imagine an eval function.
2. callbacks defined for the evaluation of tree structures using functional programming style. we want to define an api as a series of semantic callbacks with full details. this can be embedded in a function and executed when needed. this function can also be dynamically called or created by a user.
